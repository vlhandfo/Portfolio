I am a creative and curious individual with a strong passion for learning through hands-on experience. With expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP), I thrive when solving complex problems and tackling puzzles, always seeking innovative solutions. My work is deeply rooted in my ethical values, and I prioritize integrity and responsible practices in every project I undertake. 

## Education
I am currently finishing my Master's in Informatics: Language Technology at the University of Oslo after having completed the Bachelor's program. My thesis focuses on linguistic representativeness of large language models from a typological perspective. Additionally, I have a Bachelor's degree in Music and German from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
